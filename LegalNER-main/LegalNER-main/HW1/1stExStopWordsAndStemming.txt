Stopwords: 
	Advantages:
		For many tasks (such as domain specific classification) stop words do not cary much important semantic information - because the output of the task is determined by other elements in the input (such as domain terminology)
		
		Deleting stopwords diminishes the input dimensionality. Machine Learning algorithms usually perform better if less informative features are removed.

	Disadvantages:
		Some stopwords may cary important semantic information, which for some tasks such as sentiment analysis can be crucial.
	
		Removing the stopwords from the corpus for text generation means inability to generate them afterwards which leads to unnatural and incoherent texts. 

Stemming:
	Advantage:
		As with stopwords removal -> diminishing of input dimensionality (vocabulary size is made smaller)
	
		Fast and rule-based -> well defined output -> engineer knows what to expect

	Disadvantages:
		Loss of semantic and grammatical meaning-> introduction of sometimes unnecessary ambiguity

		Some words cannot be mapped to their root-like forms, others are mapped to stemms that cary totaly different meaning, most are mapped to meaningLess stemms.
